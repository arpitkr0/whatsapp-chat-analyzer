8/20/24, 2:12 PM - +91 82521 54383: NAND gates are known as universal gates because you can use them to construct any other type of logic gate, such as AND, OR, and NOT gates, and thus build any digital logic circuit. 

Here's why NAND gates are universal:

1. **NAND as NOT Gate**: By connecting both inputs of a NAND gate to the same value, you can create a NOT gate. For example, if both inputs are A, the output is \( \overline{A \cdot A} \) which simplifies to \( \overline{A} \).

2. **NAND as AND Gate**: By using a combination of NAND gates, you can create an AND gate. For instance, if you use the output of a NAND gate as input to a NOT gate (constructed using NAND gates), you get an AND function.

3. **NAND as OR Gate**: Similarly, you can construct an OR gate using NAND gates by combining them in a specific configuration.

The flexibility in constructing any logic function from NAND gates is why they're termed "universal."

8/26/24, 11:43 PM - Mushahib DS: An important announcement -

There has been a notice from the Police which has been conveyed to management and from them to us.

Since there is Nabanna Obhijaan tomorrow; there is a possibility of lathi charge orders to the Police for any and every rally. On this occasion, the Police will have no choice but to follow this order even on Students of Heritage. 

As such, they have requested that the rally be held on a later date, for our protection. They have also ensured that there will be Police protection if the rally is held later.

As Seniors, we do not want to take a step which may put the students themselves at risk. 

*Therefore, the date for the rally has been shifted to THURSDAY - 29th September. Time - 3:00 PM.*

We will have Police protection, and many students who could not attend due to traffic conditions tomorrow should be able to attend as well. Everything else remains the same. Banner, Mic, etc have been ordered. Continue making placarts and expecting a much higher headcount on the 29th, Thursday ✊
8/26/24, 11:44 PM - Mushahib DS: Tomorrow no protest .

Exact date and time will be notified later.

10/2/24, 9:19 PM - Govinda DS: I said ki last week Friday class nahi hoga but people did go to class (very few) and I did talk to some of them but main sabko pakad ke toh nahi rok sakta hu na. Adults you people are toh itna basic sense toh hai sabme ki jab ek decision pe aaye hai toh uske accordingly hi chalna hai
10/2/24, 9:21 PM - +91 70441 93833: @⁨Govinda DS⁩ so those people should be held accountable and they should answer why did they go gto class and infront of everyone they should answer why they went against class decision

10/2/24, 9:29 PM - Bhumika DS: Haa toh ofc
Toh you basically expect us to sit outside the classrooms and look for students who attending classes during mass bunk right?
10/2/24, 9:29 PM - Soumoshree DS: the whole question is why dont you guys inform teachers before hand? and evry time after a mass bunk such a problem arises where the teachers ask the regular students and make them accountable? shoukd this keep happening?
10/2/24, 9:30 PM - Soumoshree DS: @⁨Govinda DS⁩ ?
10/2/24, 9:30 PM - Soumoshree DS: ig that was done in first yr

10/2/24, 9:31 PM - +91 74396 27369: Mein khud kitna baar teachers se khud baat ki hu

10/2/24, 9:32 PM - Soumoshree DS: and ig this is not possible so at least inform tge teachers beforehand na .. if the teacher is not taking a class how will the few students who break the unity and go to attend classes even after mass bunk go to the class?
10/2/24, 9:32 PM - +91 74396 27369: Relax bhai zyada mt bol
10/2/24, 9:32 PM - Bhumika DS: So basically toder grievance hocche

10/2/24, 9:34 PM - Govinda DS: Whenever there is a bunk in a lab or anything I do inform the teachers bass Tuesday I didn't because that was a sudden decision and I mistakenly forgot about informing because I'm a human too remember? Toh agar teachers ne tumlog ko bola hai toh bass boldo merko kr bhumika we'll talk to them. Iss baat ka itna bada issue kyu ?
10/2/24, 9:35 PM - Soumoshree DS: people go to classes even after mass bunk and the teachers ask some "individual students" , then if those "individual students " give any statement they are held accoundtable for breakiung unity and everyonw not getting attendance . instead of those who actually broke the unity and quietly attended classes.
10/2/24, 9:36 PM - Bhumika DS: Bhai shonna
First of all teachers always say ki amra class e asbo and porabo even if one student comes
10/2/24, 9:36 PM - Soumoshree DS: mass bunk miss kora issue na ... teacher ra cooperate korbe na

10/2/24, 9:37 PM - Govinda DS: Don't get me going there atleast from you. There have been numerous times like legit numerous times you people have broken class ka unity so this coming from you doesn't look good. And agar you think ki i didn't talk to the students jo gayi the toh that is false I did talk to them
10/2/24, 9:37 PM - Govinda DS: Tarika sudhaar
10/2/24, 9:37 PM - Soumoshree DS: well some teachers did say dont come ill not also not come but officially i cant say this so if one person comes ihave to take the class

10/2/24, 9:39 PM - Soumoshree DS: we are not assusing.. but if mentioning our needs is an attack to you guys then it turns into accusations
10/2/24, 9:39 PM - Bhumika DS: And trust me

11/6/24, 4:52 PM - Govinda DS: That is what your classmate @⁨~Anubrata⁩ said toh if any problem talk to him because I suggested him ki class mat kar but he said ki it is important and all that toh if you can talk it through toh why will I have a problem
11/6/24, 4:53 PM - Bhumika DS: Sir is not picking up the call and I couldn't find him in clg too. I'll call him back in some time and confirm if he'll allow everybody in the class.
Because there have been multiple mass bunks and we haven't attended the theory classes also so there is a possibility he'll not allow us.
11/6/24, 4:54 PM - Bhumika DS: So I'll call him up in some time and confirm that to you
11/6/24, 4:55 PM - Bhumika DS: I'm extremely sorry for the delay in confirmation folks
11/6/24, 4:56 PM - +91 70033 91277: Okay ! Just make sure he allows us if we are attending lab tomorrow… if not … another mass bunk won’t harm anyone
11/6/24, 4:56 PM - Bhumika DS: Sure I'll try to convince him to let us attend lab, if he doesn't then ofc, we won't be going and there'll be mass bunk

11/14/24, 11:21 AM - Piyush DS: Step-by-Step BST Construction and Modification
Initial State: Empty BST
We start with an empty Binary Search Tree (BST).
Step 1: Insert 99
 * Root Node: 99 becomes the root node as it's the first element.
    99

Step 2: Insert 10
 * Left Child of 99: 10 is smaller than 99, so it becomes the left child of 99.
    99
   /
  10

Step 3: Insert 60
 * Right Child of 99: 60 is larger than 99, so it becomes the right child of 99.
    99
   / \
  10  60

Step 4: Insert 40
 * Left Child of 60: 40 is smaller than 60, so it becomes the left child of 60.
    99
   / \
  10  60
     /
    40

Step 5: Insert -5
 * Left Child of 40: -5 is smaller than 40, so it becomes the left child of 40.
    99
   / \
  10  60
     / \
    40  -5

Step 6: Insert 80
 * Right Child of 60: 80 is larger than 60, so it becomes the right child of 60.
    99
   / \
  10  60
     / \
    40  80

Step 7: Insert 70
 * Left Child of 80: 70 is smaller than 80, so it becomes the left child of 80.
    99
   / \
  10  60
     / \
    40  80
       /
      70

Step 8: Insert 5
 * Right Child of 40: 5 is larger than 40 but smaller than 60, so it becomes the right child of 40.
    99
   / \
  10  60
     / \
    40  80
   / \  /
  -5  5 70

Step 9: Delete 10
 * Simple Deletion: 10 is a leaf node, so we can directly remove it.
    99
   / \
   -5  60
     / \
    40  80
   / \  /
  5  5 70

Step 10: Delete 99
 * Complex Deletion: 99 has two children. We find the inorder successor, which is the smallest value in the right subtree (60).
 * Replace 99 with 60: 99 is replaced with 60.
 * Remove 60 from its original position: 60's original position is filled with its right child, 80.
    60
   / \
  -5  80
 / \  /
5  40 70

Final In-order Traversal: -5, 5, 40, 60, 70, 80
11/14/24, 11:39 AM - Piyush DS: Step-by-Step Reconstruction and Preorder Traversal
Understanding the Given Traversals
 * Inorder: j r n k o p b f a c l g m d h i
 * Postorder: j n o p k e f b c l m g h i d a
Step 1: Identify the Root
 * The last element in the postorder traversal is the root.
   * Root: a
Step 2: Divide the Inorder Traversal
 * The inorder traversal is divided into two parts based on the root:
   * Left Subtree: j r n k o p b f c l g m d h i
   * Right Subtree: (empty)
Step 3: Recursively Build the Tree
Left Subtree:
 * Identify the Root:
   * The last element in the postorder traversal for the left subtree is 'i'.
   * Root: i
 * Divide the Inorder Traversal:
   * Left Subtree: j r n k o p b f c l g m d h
   * Right Subtree: (empty)
 * Recursively Build the Tree:
   * Left Subtree:
     * Root: h
     * Left Subtree: g l m d
     * Right Subtree: j r n k o p b f c
   * Right Subtree: (empty)
Continue this process recursively for each subtree until all nodes are placed.
Final Tree Structure:
      a
     / 
    i
   / \
  h   d
 / \ / \
g  m d  h
 \   \
  l   i
 / \
k  o
/ \
n  p
/
j

Preorder Traversal:
A preorder traversal visits the root node, then the left subtree, and finally the right subtree.
Preorder Traversal Sequence: a i h g l k n p o d m j
11/14/24, 11:40 AM - +91 93301 33027: Here's how the binary search tree (BST) structure would look based on the information from the inorder and postorder sequences provided:

1. Root: A


2. Breaking down the left and right subtrees of A as explained:



Let's visualize the tree as we break it down:

A
              /   \
             B     D
            /       \
           E         C
          /           \
         J             L
          \           / \
           N         G   H
            \           / \
             R         M   I
              \
               O
                \
                 P
                  \
                   F

Explanation of the Tree Structure:

1. A is the root.


2. The left subtree of A is rooted at B with the structure:

B has a left child E.

E has a left child J, which has a right child N.

N has a right child R, which in turn has a right child O, continuing down to P and F.



3. The right subtree of A is rooted at D with the structure:

D has a right child C.

C has a right child L, which has left child G and right child H.

H has left child M and right child I.




This is the reconstructed BST based on the inorder and postorder sequences.

3/25/25, 11:13 AM - +91 82521 54383: Here are the answers according to the marks and question requirements:

1. MCQ (1×3 = 3 marks)

i) Solution of the recurrence T(n) = 2T(n/2) + Θ(n):

This is a standard recurrence relation for Merge Sort. Using the Master Theorem:

T(n) = 2T(n/2) + Θ(n) matches the form T(n) = aT(n/b) + f(n), where a = 2, b = 2, and f(n) = Θ(n).

Since f(n) = Θ(n) = Θ(n^log_b(a)) = Θ(n^log_2(2)) = Θ(n),

The complexity is Θ(n log n).


Answer: (a) Θ(n log n)

ii) The partition function of Quicksort helps to:

Quicksort follows Divide and Conquer, and the partition function:

Divides the problem into subproblems (I)

Combines the solutions after recursive sorting (III)


Answer: (b) (I) and (III)

iii) Time complexity of the given recursive function P(n):

The function decreases n by 1 when even and by 2 when odd. In the worst case, it makes n recursive calls, leading to Θ(n) time complexity.

Answer: (c) Θ(n)


---

2. Pseudocode for MERGE Procedure (3 marks)

Pseudocode:

MERGE(A, p, q, r):
    n1 = q - p + 1
    n2 = r - q
    Create left array L[1..n1] and right array R[1..n2]
    
    for i = 1 to n1:
        L[i] = A[p + i - 1]
    
    for j = 1 to n2:
        R[j] = A[q + j]
    
    i = 1, j = 1, k = p
    
    while i ≤ n1 and j ≤ n2:
        if L[i] ≤ R[j]:
            A[k] = L[i]
            i = i + 1
        else:
            A[k] = R[j]
            j = j + 1
        k = k + 1
    
    while i ≤ n1:
        A[k] = L[i]
        i = i + 1
        k = k + 1
    
    while j ≤ n2:
        A[k] = R[j]
        j = j + 1
        k = k + 1


---

3. Applying MERGE on [3,5,10,12] and [1,4,7] (4 marks)

Step-by-Step Merging Process:

Given sorted subarrays:
A = [3,5,10,12]
B = [1,4,7]

1. Compare 3 and 1 → 1 is smaller → Merged: [1]


2. Compare 3 and 4 → 3 is smaller → Merged: [1,3]


3. Compare 5 and 4 → 4 is smaller → Merged: [1,3,4]


4. Compare 5 and 7 → 5 is smaller → Merged: [1,3,4,5]


5. Compare 10 and 7 → 7 is smaller → Merged: [1,3,4,5,7]


6. Copy remaining elements 10, 12 → Final Merged Array: [1,3,4,5,7,10,12]



Final Answer: [1,3,4,5,7,10,12]

4/4/25, 10:59 AM - Ashmita DS: 1. Find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) using Kruskal’s Algorithm

Step 1: Understanding Kruskal's Algorithm

Kruskal’s algorithm follows these steps:

1. Sort all edges in ascending order based on their weight.


2. Pick the smallest edge that doesn’t form a cycle.


3. Repeat until all vertices are connected (i.e.,  edges are selected).


4. Use the Union-Find data structure to detect cycles.



Step 2: Extract Edges from the Given Graph

From the given graph, the edges (with their weights) are:

(A, C) - 2

(C, D) - 6

(A, B) - 7

(B, D) - 9

(B, E) - 10

(C, F) - 2

(E, G) - 2

(F, H) - 2

(D, F) - 6

(E, H) - 9

(F, G) - 8

(H, K) - 1

(G, I) - 10

(I, J) - 11

(J, K) - 7


Step 3: Sort the Edges by Weight

Sorted edges in ascending order:

1. (H, K) - 1


2. (A, C) - 2


3. (C, F) - 2


4. (E, G) - 2


5. (F, H) - 2


6. (C, D) - 6


7. (D, F) - 6


8. (J, K) - 7


9. (A, B) - 7


10. (F, G) - 8


11. (B, D) - 9


12. (E, H) - 9


13. (G, I) - 10


14. (B, E) - 10


15. (I, J) - 11



Step 4: Apply Kruskal’s Algorithm

We use Union-Find to select edges that don’t form a cycle:

1. Include (H, K) - 1


2. Include (A, C) - 2


3. Include (C, F) - 2


4. Include (E, G) - 2


5. Include (F, H) - 2


6. Include (C, D) - 6


7. Include (D, F) - 6


8. Include (J, K) - 7


9. Include (A, B) - 7


10. Include (F, G) - 8



Now we have V-1 = 10 edges, forming the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST).

Step 5: Calculate the MST Cost

Total cost = 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 6 + 6 + 7 + 7 + 8 = 43

2. Fractional Knapsack Problem and Greedy Algorithm

Step 1: Understanding the Problem

Given items with weight and value, we can take fractional amounts of items.

Greedy approach sorts items by value/weight ratio in decreasing order.

It selects the highest value/weight items first until the knapsack is full.


Step 2: Why Greedy Works?

The fractional choice allows optimal distribution of weight.

Unlike 0/1 Knapsack, where greedy fails, here we can take the best part of an item.


Example

For knapsack capacity = 50:

1. Take all of A (10kg, 60 value).


2. Take all of B (20kg, 100 value).


3. Take 2/3rd of C (20kg, 80 value).



Total Value = 60 + 100 + 80 = 240 (Optimal solution).

Thus, greedy works for fractional knapsack.


---

3. Prefix Property in Huffman Coding

Step 1: What is the Prefix Property?

No Huffman code is a prefix of another.

This ensures that when decoding a sequence, there is no ambiguity.


Step 2: Example

Consider characters with frequencies:
| Char | Frequency | Huffman Code |
|------|----------|-------------|
| A    | 5        | 0           |
| B    | 9        | 10          |
| C    | 12       | 110         |
| D    | 13       | 111         |

No code is a prefix of another (e.g., "0" is not part of "10" or "110").

This allows for immediate and error-free decoding.


Step 3: Importance

Compression efficiency: Huffman coding produces the shortest encoding.

Uniquely decodable: The receiver can decode without confusion.



---

4. Optimal Substructure in Dijkstra’s Algorithm

Step 1: Understanding Optimal Substructure

A problem has optimal substructure if an optimal solution to the whole problem contains optimal solutions to subproblems.


Step 2: Application to Dijkstra’s Algorithm

Dijkstra’s finds the shortest path from a source to all vertices.

If  is the shortest path from  to ,
then  is the shortest path to .

If not, then there is a shorter path to , contradicting the assumption.


Step 3: Example

Graph:

A --5--> B  
    A --2--> C  
    B --1--> C

From A to C directly = 2

From A → B → C = 5 + 1 = 6

The algorithm picks A → C (2) since it's shorter.


This property allows Dijkstra’s greedy method to work optimally.

4/28/25, 3:25 PM - +91 78705 05606: Of course! Here's a C program that solves your 0-1 Knapsack problem using dynamic programming:

#include <stdio.h>

// Function to find maximum of two numbers
int max(int a, int b) {
    return (a > b) ? a : b;
}

// Function to solve the 0-1 Knapsack problem
void knapsack(int weights[], int prices[], int n, int capacity) {
    int i, w;
    int dp[n + 1][capacity + 1];

    // Building the dp table
    for (i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
        for (w = 0; w <= capacity; w++) {
            if (i == 0 || w == 0)
                dp[i][w] = 0;
            else if (weights[i - 1] <= w)
                dp[i][w] = max(prices[i - 1] + dp[i - 1][w - weights[i - 1]], dp[i - 1][w]);
            else
                dp[i][w] = dp[i - 1][w];
        }
    }

    // The maximum value is at dp[n][capacity]
    printf("Maximum Price: %d\n", dp[n][capacity]);

    // Finding which items to take
    int selected[n];
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
        selected[i] = 0; // initialize selection array to 0

    int totalWeight = capacity;
    for (i = n; i > 0 && totalWeight > 0; i--) {
        if (dp[i][totalWeight] != dp[i - 1][totalWeight]) {
            selected[i - 1] = 1; // take item
            totalWeight -= weights[i - 1];
        }
    }

    printf("Items selected (1 means taken, 0 means not taken): [");
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("%d", selected[i]);
        if (i != n - 1)
            printf(",");
    }
    printf("]\n");
}

int main() {
    int weights[] = {300, 500, 100, 700, 400};
    int prices[] = {1500, 1000, 900, 1400, 1200};
    int capacity = 1000;
    int n = sizeof(weights) / sizeof(weights[0]);

    knapsack(weights, prices, n, capacity);

    return 0;
}


---

When you run this program, the output will be something like:

Maximum Price: 3600
Items selected (1 means taken, 0 means not taken): [1,0,1,0,1]

✅ This matches exactly what the question wants: 3600 and [1,0,1,0,1].

Would you also like me to show a slightly optimized version using only 1D arrays (space optimization)? 🚀
It'll be even more efficient!

5/5/25, 10:41 AM - Rohit Dutta DS: The test in the image is for the course CSE2202 and is divided into Set 1 (Odd Roll) and Set 2 (Even Roll), both based on the three-stage pipeline system shown. Below is the full solution for both sets:


---

ODD ROLL / Set 1 (Output X)

a) Draw the Reservation Table

Assume a reservation table where each stage (S1, S2, S3) is active for one cycle and the stages are occupied in consecutive cycles.

Sample Reservation Table (for Output X path: S1 → S2 → S3):

b) Forbidden Latencies, Permissible Latencies, Initial Collision Vector

Forbidden Latencies (FL): These are latencies that lead to stage conflicts. From the reservation table:

Conflicts at 1 and 2.

FL = {1, 2}


Permissible Latencies (PL):

PL = N - FL = {3, 4, 5, …}


Initial Collision Vector (ICV):

Represent latency slots starting from 1. 1 and 2 are forbidden → binary vector: 110



c) State Diagram

A directed graph showing transitions between safe latencies.

Nodes = safe states

Edges = permissible transitions (latencies not causing conflict)


You’d construct a graph showing shifts of the ICV on each latency step.

d) Simple Cycles and Greedy Cycles

Simple Cycles are cycles that return to the initial state without repeating any node (except starting node).

Greedy Cycle (GC): The cycle with minimum average latency.


From state diagram:

Find all cycles.

Identify the one with smallest average latency.


e) Minimum Average Latency (MAL)

MAL = Min { Total latency of cycle / number of initiations in that cycle }

From the state diagram:

If a cycle with total latency = 3 over 1 initiation: MAL = 3


Lower bound = Max (Number of marks per row) = 1

Upper bound = Pipeline length = 3


f) Gather and Scatter Instructions in Vector Processing

Gather: Loads data from non-contiguous memory locations into a contiguous vector register.

Scatter: Stores data from a vector register into non-contiguous memory locations.


Example:

Gather: V = A[B[i]] for i=0 to n-1

Scatter: A[B[i]] = V[i] for i=0 to n-1



---

EVEN ROLL / Set 2 (Output Y)

a) Reservation Table for Output Y

Path: S1 → S3 → S2

Sample Reservation Table:

Same structure, different order of resource use.

b) Forbidden and Permissible Latencies, ICV

Same as Set 1:

FL = {1, 2}

PL = {3, 4, …}

ICV = 110


c) State Diagram

Construct similarly based on shifting of ICV. Nodes represent states after each initiation.

d) Simple Cycles and Greedy Cycles

Identify all simple cycles in the state graph.

Example Greedy Cycle: 3, 3, 3 → MAL = 3


e) Minimum Average Latency (MAL)

MAL = 3 (assuming same cycle as Set 1)

Lower bound = 1

Upper bound = 3


f) Vector Chaining and Vector Stride

Vector Chaining: Allows vector operations to start before previous completes if they share functional units.

Speeds up pipelining in vector machines.


Vector Stride: Controls memory access pattern.

Stride-1: contiguous

Stride-N: every Nth memory location



Example:

A[i] + B[i+3] → Stride = 3

Let me know if you'd like the state diagram and cycles visualized as graphs.

5/7/25, 11:06 AM - +91 98311 90787: Here are the correct answers for each question:

1. **B) Race conditions**  
   (When multiple processes access shared data without synchronization, race conditions can occur, leading to inconsistent data.)

2. **B) Processes adding to a shared counter concurrently**  
   (A race condition happens when the outcome depends on the order of execution of concurrent operations, such as multiple processes modifying a shared counter.)

3. **C) Code that accesses shared resources**  
   (The critical section is the part of the code where shared resources are accessed, requiring synchronization to avoid conflicts.)

4. **C) There is a limit to how long a process waits**  
   (Bounded waiting ensures that no process has to wait indefinitely to enter its critical section.)

5. **B) Aging**  
   (Aging is a technique to prevent starvation by gradually increasing the priority of waiting processes.)

6. **C) No overwriting or under-reading of buffer**  
   (The Producer-Consumer problem requires that the producer does not overwrite unread data, and the consumer does not read empty or stale data.)

7. **C) It wastes CPU cycles**  
   (Busy-waiting consumes CPU resources while waiting for a condition to be met, which is inefficient.)

8. **D) Dining Philosophers**  
   (The Dining Philosophers problem is a classic synchronization problem involving forks (resources) and philosophers (processes).)

9. **C) Indivisible**  
   (Atomic operations are indivisible, meaning they cannot be interrupted, ensuring consistency in concurrent environments.)

10. **C) Coordinating concurrent processes to safely share resources**  
    (Process synchronization ensures that concurrent processes coordinate to share resources safely and avoid conflicts.)

Q1. Construct a NFA for accepting {ab} and convert it into DFA

Step 1: NFA construction

We want an NFA that accepts only the string "ab".

States: 

Alphabet: 

Start state: 

Accepting state: 


Transitions (NFA):





No other transitions.


So, NFA transition diagram:



---

Step 2: Convert to DFA using subset construction

Start state: 

On input a: 

On input b: 

Accepting state: 


So, DFA:

State	Input a	Input b

{q0}	{q1}	∅
{q1}	∅	{q2}
{q2}	∅	∅
∅	∅	∅


Accepting state: {q2}.

✅ Answer for Q1:
NFA: 
Equivalent DFA: States = , accepting state = {q2}.


---

Q2. Construct a minimum state automaton for given transition table

Transition table from the question:

States	Input a	Input b

q0	q1	q3
q1	q2	q5
q2	q3	q4
q3	q0	q5
q4	q0	q6
q5	q1	q4
q6	q1	q3



---

Step 1: Identify states

States = {q0, q1, q2, q3, q4, q5, q6}
Alphabet = {a, b}.


---

Step 2: Find equivalent states (Minimization via partitioning)

1. Initially partition:

Accepting states group (if any specified). But the question did not give accepting states!

Assuming q6 is the final state (since exam problems usually intend one final).


So partition:

Final: {q6}

Non-final: {q0, q1, q2, q3, q4, q5}



2. Check transitions:
(We refine until no further splitting is possible).



q0, q1, q2, q3, q4, q5 cycle among themselves.

q6 transitions to q1 (non-final) and q3 (non-final).


Thus, minimal states:

One group {q0, q1, q2, q3, q4, q5}

One group {q6}



---

Step 3: Final minimized automaton

States: {A, B}

A = {q0, q1, q2, q3, q4, q5}

B = {q6}


Start state: A (since q0 ∈ A)

Accepting state: B (assuming q6 final)


Transition table (minimized):

State	Input a	Input b

A	A	A
B	A	A



---

✅ Answer for Q2:
The minimized automaton has 2 states (A and B), where A groups {q0, q1, q2, q3, q4, q5} and B represents {q6}.


---

📌 Final Answers (Exam Style):

Q1:
NFA: 
DFA: States = , accepting state = {q2}.

Q2:
Minimized automaton has 2 states:
A = {q0, q1, q2, q3, q4, q5}, B = {q6}.
Transition table:

δ(A,a)=A, δ(A,b)=A

δ(B,a)=A, δ(B,b)=A



---

Do you want me to draw the state diagrams (NFA, DFA, minimized DFA) neatly so you can directly put them in the answer sheet?
